If your home is not prepared for the coming winter season||||| you could end up paying the price for it.</p><p>Here are some tips to help save you cash and spare you the trouble of having to deal with plumbing issues during as the weather cools down:</p><p><strong>1.</strong><strong>Protect your pipes from freezing:</strong> When the temperature drops||||| water can freeze within your pipes||||| causing them to burst. If you are away or simply unaware of the burst pipe||||| the results of this can be devastating||||| leading to massive floods and damage to your furniture||||| rugs||||| and the home’s structure. To reduce the chances of frozen pipes. Wrap your un-insulated pipes in a blanket of foam||||| which can be purchased at any hardware store. To secure it||||| use duct tape. In some cases||||| the foam might have self-adhesive edges.</p><p><strong>2.</strong><strong>Fix plumbing leaks:</strong> Do not put off getting home plumbing leaks fixed. Check the faucets in your kitchen||||| bathrooms||||| and utility rooms for any drips or puddles. If any of your faucets are leaking||||| contact a plumber immediately to get your pipes back in shape.</p><p><strong>3.</strong><strong>Drain your water heater: </strong>Does your area have hard water? If so||||| sediment can build up in your tank||||| which causes rust to develop. The rust can then find its way into your drinking||||| cooking||||| and bathing water. If you have a water heater that is already rusted or is too old||||| purchase a new one before the weather gets cold.</p><p><strong>4.</strong><strong>Disconnect your garden house:</strong> If you leave your outdoor hose connected during the winter season||||| the water left inside might freeze and expand||||| affecting your faucets and other connecting pipes. The wisest thing to do is disconnect||||| wrap up||||| and put away your garden hose until the warm weather returns. The last thing you want to do is face hefty repair bills for something so avoidable.</p><p><strong>5.</strong><strong>Close and drain shut-off valves that lead outdoors: </strong>Do you have interior shut off valves that lead to outdoor faucets? Close them and drain the water out from outside lines. If any water remains in the lines||||| it could freeze and cause some major damage that will end up costing you.</p><p><strong>6.</strong><strong>Clean your home’s sump pump pit:</strong> Before the winter weather sets in||||| take the time to inspect and clean your sump pump and its pit. The pump can freeze when exposed to extremely cold weather||||| causing it to stop working. If your sump pump malfunctions||||| this can cause some serious trouble. Water can enter your basement and cause flooding||||| particularly when the winter rains start pouring. To prevent flood damage and serious clean-up bills||||| inspect your pump and pit now.</p><p>The winter time is for family and holiday gatherings. Make sure your season is full of cheer instead of exploding pipes and leaks||||| and start preparing and repairing your plumbing now. You will thank yourself later.</p><h2>Plumbing||||| Heating & Air Conditioning Services and Repair</h2><p>For the past 40 years||||| Summers Plumbing Heating & Cooling has been providing customers with superior service at affordable prices throughout Indiana and Ohio.
